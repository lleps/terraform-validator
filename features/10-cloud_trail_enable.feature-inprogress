Feature: CloudTrail is enabled for all regions
 
 
    Ensure that multi-regions trail exists
     
    Ensure Global Service Logging is enabled for a trail by default
 
    Ensure management events configured for all types of Read/Write are recorded for all resources in an AWS account
 
 
   
Scenario: Enable multi region trail
 
 
    Given I have resource aws_cloudtrail
    
    Then is_multi_region_trail = true AND include_global_service_events = true
